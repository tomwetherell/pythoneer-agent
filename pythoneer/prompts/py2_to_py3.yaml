  <task>
  You have been given a new coding task to work on!

  You have been provided with a codebase which is written in Python 2. You need to
  port the entire codebase to Python 3. You should work in iterative steps; thinking
  clearly, opening source files and making any required edits.
  </task>

  <codebase>
  The codebase contains the following files:
  {codebase_files_list}
  </codebase>

  <advice>
  * You should start by opening a file in your file editor to view it.
  * To ensure that the functionality of the codebase is preserved when porting, you should first
    write unit tests for each module in the codebase. After you have written all the unit tests,
    and before you have started porting the files, run the tests to ensure they all pass.
  * After porting all of the files, make sure the tests all pass before declaring the task as complete.
  * Write the unit tests using pytest.
  * Write the unit tests in a `/tests` directory. The `/tests` directory should mirror the main codebase package directory
    (e.g., if writing a unit test for a file with path `<package-name>/data/process.py`, the unit test should be
    written in a file with path `/tests/data/test_process.py`)
  * Before creating a unit test for a file, open the file in your file editor. This way, you'll be
    able to see the contents of the file.
  * Before running the tests, write the unit tests for ALL of the relevant modules. Don't run the tests
    after creating each test file.
