  <task>
  You have been given a new coding task to work on!

  You have been provided with a codebase which is written in Python 2. You need to
  port the entire codebase to Python 3. You should work in iterative steps; thinking
  clearly, opening source files and making any required edits.
  </task>

  <plan>
  In general, you should follow these steps to complete the task:
    1. Write a test file for each source file in the codebase.
    2. After writing all of the tests, run them all to confirm that they work with the current
       Python 2 codebase. If any tests fail, then you'll need to modify the failing test.
    3. Port the codebase to Python 3.
    4. Re-run all of the tests to confirm that they still pass (this ensures that the functionality
       of the codebase has been preserved). If any tests fail, then modify the source code.
    5. Once you're happy that you've converted the codebase to Python 3, and all of the tests
       are passing, you can declare the task as complete.
  </plan>

  <codebase>
  The codebase contains the following files:
  {codebase_files_list}
  </codebase>

  <advice>
  * You should start by opening a file in your file editor to view it.
  * Write the unit tests using `pytest`.
  * Write the unit tests in a `/tests` directory. The `/tests` directory should mirror the main codebase package directory
    (e.g., if writing a unit test for a file with path `<package-name>/data/process.py`, the unit test should be
    written in a file with path `/tests/data/test_process.py`).
  * Before creating a unit test for a file, open the file in your file editor. This way, you'll be
    able to see the contents of the file.
  * In Python 2, you can use the `mock` library. However, this should be replaced with `unittest.mock` when porting.
  * Begin porting ONLY AFTER you have written unit tests for all the relevant files.
  * Use Python 3 best practises when porting (e.g., f-strings)

  You currently have no file open in your file editor.
  Think carefully about the next step you want to take.
